# WEwebLoader (browser-side Wallpaper Engine wallpaper renderer)

[中文](README.md) | **[English](README.en.md)**

**Render Wallpaper Engine scene wallpapers in the browser, live** (`scene.pkg` / this project's `.mpkg` container / a Workshop source folder) —
no Wallpaper Engine, no Windows, no GPU-specific driver required: a local Node static server plus a WebGL2-capable browser is all it takes.

- Published on npm: [wallpaper-engine-web-loader@0.5.10](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wallpaper-engine-web-loader)
- [Online demo](https://xhr666.github.io/wallpaper-engine-web-loader/)
- [Disclaimer](#disclaimer)
- [References & credits](#7-references--credits)

**Search aliases**: **WEwebLoader** · WE Web Loader · we-web-loader ·
wallpaper-engine-web-loader · WE 场景壁纸网页渲染器 · 壁纸引擎网页渲染器 — any of these should find this repository;
the npm package name and the repository name stay **unchanged** (`wallpaper-engine-web-loader`), and the online demo is at
<https://xhr666.github.io/wallpaper-engine-web-loader/>.

> **Naming note (2026-09-19)**:
> This project has two names
> - **WEwebLoader**
> - the npm package name and repository name are still **`wallpaper-engine-web-loader`**

> **Licence notice for the reference sources**: `wer-ref/` (`Aromatic05/wallpaper-engine-renderer`, a fork of `catsout/wallpaper-scene-renderer`, **GPL-2.0-only**) and
> `we-layerd-ref/` (`Aromatic05/we-layerd`, **no licence**) are both **third-party reference implementations outside this repository**; they are not official WE code and not a "source of truth".
> They are used **for behavioural comparison only**: **no copying, rewriting or line-by-line translation of their code, comments, constant organisation or error messages**. For the lineage self-audit see `docs/WER-REF-LICENSE-AUDIT.md`.

**The main README is `README.md`** (shown on the GitHub home page; this file is its English translation). For downloader-facing instructions see `docs/README-PUBLIC.md`; development/diagnostic documents are in `docs/` (architecture `docs/RENDERER-ARCHITECTURE.md`, flags `docs/README-DIAGNOSTICS.md`, tests `docs/TESTING.md`, **real-machine baseline snapshots (FPS/startup/switch-timing trends, `?baseline=1` + the `tools/baseline-diff.mjs` regression gate) in `docs/BASELINE.md`**, per-round records `docs/PATCHES.md`);

## 1. Quick start (two routes, pick one)

### A. With the bundled server (recommended, most complete)
```bash
bash start-demo.sh                     # preflight + start the server (default 8899); equivalent: node server/we-scene-demo-server.mjs
# open http://127.0.0.1:8899/ in the browser
```
The bundled server provides: package/folder reading, `/report` report persistence, the `/weassist` WE-asset fallback, CORS (for iframe embedding)
and offline PWA (`web/manifest.webmanifest` + `web/sw.js`, whose **cache predicate explicitly excludes user wallpapers** — see `tests/pwa-test.mjs`).
The port is overridable: `PORT=9000 bash start-demo.sh` (or `bash start-demo.sh --port 9000`); preflight only, without starting the server: `bash start-demo.sh --check`.

> **Want "the bench page with a backend"** (wallpaper library list / property saving / deletion / renderer diagnostic stream all working)? That is **another** server —
> `node server/we-scene-demo-server-8902.mjs` ⇒ open `http://127.0.0.1:8902/` (one origin serving the `demo/` static surface +
> the 8 `/api/*` routes the bench needs + the renderer iframe page with hard-coded artefacts + the `/media/dev` media surface + the `/diag` diagnostic stream; see `docs/BENCH-8902.md`).

First paint: if this machine has a corpus, the default package is rendered; when there is **no corpus** (this repository does not distribute real wallpapers) the page says so explicitly and renders the bundled synthetic sample instead
(you can also open `http://127.0.0.1:8899/?id=sample-synthetic` directly).

### B. Any static server (read-only mode)
```bash
node build-pages.mjs                   # zero dependencies, no network: builds a static site into ./_site (whitelist + privacy gate + required-file self-check)
python3 -m http.server 8899 -d _site   # or npx serve _site
# open http://127.0.0.1:8899/demo.html?id=sample-synthetic in the browser
```
In static mode the renderer still opens, but the features that depend on server endpoints (package proxy, `/report`, WE-asset fallback) are unavailable.
The online version is exactly this shape: <https://xhr666.github.io/wallpaper-engine-web-loader/> (build script `build-pages.mjs`, CI in `.github/workflows/pages.yml`).

---

## Install options (three, choose by scenario)

> This chapter and the “Data limits” and “Disclaimer” blocks **do not take section numbers**: this README's section numbers are referenced by footnotes (§7 and its §7.1(2) / §7.4(2)),
> and numbering them would shift every later section and mis-point those references. Structural self-check: `grep -n '^## ' README.en.md`.

### A. Install from npm (embed the renderer as a dependency in your own site/app)
```bash
npm i wallpaper-engine-web-loader@0.5.10     # pin the published version; or npm i wallpaper-engine-web-loader to follow latest
```
Minimal usage (the snippet below is measured to work: `parsePkg` 8 entries, `parseScene` 5 layers):
```js
import fs from 'node:fs'
import { mount, parseScene } from 'wallpaper-engine-web-loader'         // library entry = core/we-scene.mjs
import { parsePkg, getEntry } from 'wallpaper-engine-web-loader/bundle' // low-level parsing = core/we-scene-bundle.js

const pkg       = parsePkg(new Uint8Array(fs.readFileSync('scene.pkg')))
const sceneJson = JSON.parse(new TextDecoder().decode(getEntry(pkg, 'scene.json')))
const project   = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('project.json', 'utf8'))   // pass null if there is no properties table
const scene     = parseScene(sceneJson, project, {})

// mounting in the browser (mount needs requestAnimationFrame; in Node the host injects opts.raf)
const h = mount('#stage', { scene, textures /* Map<name, {glTex}>, same shape as demo.html */ })
h.setQuality({ q: 'high', aa: 'fxaa', pp: 'high' })   // hot-updates, no remount needed
h.dispose()
```
- `mount`'s responsibility boundary is **only** "canvas + frame loop + end-of-frame post-processing chain": **package fetching / unpacking / texture upload / fonts / audio / reporting / UI panels** all belong to the host side
  (the full reference implementation is `demo.html`'s `bootInstance()`, whose frame order matches `mount` item for item).
- Other subpath exports: `wallpaper-engine-web-loader/server` (the bundled server), `/hlsl2glsl` (the vendored MIT translator).

### B. Run straight from source (recommended locally / for development)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/XHR666/wallpaper-engine-web-loader.git
cd wallpaper-engine-web-loader
bash start-demo.sh                    # preflight + start the server (default 8899)
bash check.sh                         # the single entry point for release/self-check: three static gates + the full regression suite
```
- The bundled server needs a package parser (from the MIT plugin `dsh-mpkg-wallpaper`, `lib/pkg-extract.js`): put it in the **same parent directory** as the renderer,
  or point at it with `MPW_PKG_EXTRACT=/absolute/path/pkg-extract.js` (`start-demo.sh`'s preflight prints all three fixes directly).
- Keep real wallpapers **outside** the repository and point at them with `MPW_SCENE_ROOT` / `?pkgpath=` / `?pkgurl=` (see §2/§3).
- Layer-by-layer debugging `/?ln=1`; diagnostic pages `/diag` and `/probe`. Self-proof: `bash check.sh --json` (expect `{"pass":4,...,"fail":0}`),
  `node tests/demo-check.mjs` (the online published shape), `node tests/publish-check.mjs` (release gate), `npm run test:fast` (full regression, skipping the slowest items).

### C. Pure static / offline (read-only mode)
```bash
node build-pages.mjs && python3 -m http.server 8899 -d _site   # or any static server (Pages/object storage/intranet)
```
You can also use only the `npm pack` artefacts (unpacked, they are a directory you can host statically):
```bash
npm pack wallpaper-engine-web-loader@0.5.10     # produces wallpaper-engine-web-loader-0.5.10.tgz
tar -xzf wallpaper-engine-web-loader-0.5.10.tgz   # unpacks to package/ (containing demo.html / elysia/ / samples/ etc.)
```
- **Limitations (the price of read-only mode)**: with no server endpoints ⇒ the package proxy, `/report` persistence, the WE-asset fallback and folder packing (`/pkgdir`) are all unavailable;
  you can only use packages the **browser can fetch directly** (the bundled sample, or a `scene.pkg` same-origin with the page).
- **The PWA is optional**: off by default; only the **bundled server** with `MPW_PWA=1` injects it (`MPW_PWA=1 bash start-demo.sh`, or `?pwa=1` on a single request). Static hosting does not gain offline capability automatically.

### Environment requirements and the "is it installed?" self-check
- **Node ≥ 20** (`package.json`'s `engines.node` = `>=20`; the scripts use `??`, optional chaining, top-level await and `node:`-prefixed builtins; **ESM only**, no CJS entry).
- The browser side needs **WebGL2** (without a GPU it falls back to the CPU path, markedly slower).
- The self-check is the `bash check.sh --json` line from A / B above (all 4 stages PASS); for just the second-scale static gates add `--no-gate`.

## Directory structure (layered by "responsibility for handling wallpaper data")

| Path | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| root | **Entry points**: `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `THIRD-PARTY.md`, `package.json`, `start-demo.sh` (launch), `check.sh` (self-check), `build-pages.mjs` (build), `index.html` (landing page), `demo.html` (renderer page, which is the site root) |
| `core/` | **Parsing and rendering kernel**: `we-scene.mjs` (library entry `mount()`), `we-scene-bundle.js` (PKG/TEX/MDL parsing + the WebGL2 renderer), `scene-project-json.mjs` (the project.json lookup chain), `attach-transform.mjs` (attachment anchors), `puppet-skin.js` (skinning) |
| `server/` | **Local server side and packing IO**: `we-scene-demo-server.mjs` (the `:8899` renderer page: static serving + `/report` `/baseline` `/weassist` `/pkgdir` and other routes), `we-scene-demo-server-8902.mjs` (the `:8902` one-stop bench: static surface + `/api/*` + renderer iframe + media surface + `/diag` stream + `/report` `/baseline` persistence), `pack-dir.mjs` (source folder → `.mpkg` container) |
| `web/` | **Site shell and offline assets**: `sw.js` + `sw-policy.mjs` (the SW and its cache predicate), `pwa-inject.mjs` (homepage injection), `manifest.webmanifest`, `icons/` (page and install icons: `brand-*` are images supplied by the repository owner, `icon-*` are script-generated and their URLs still return 200), `diag.html` / `probe.html` (diagnostic pages), `diag-flags.json` (the panel's flag data source, script-generated) |
| `tools/` | **Generators**: `make-sample.mjs` (synthetic sample, deterministic), `make-icons.mjs` (PWA icons, deterministic) |
| `tests/` | The full regression suite and gates (`run-all-tests.sh` runs everything; the three static gates `docs-check` / `publish-check` / `diag-flag-check`) |
| `docs/` | Explanatory and audit documents (`PACKAGING.md`, `RELEASE.md` (release prerequisites/commands/verification/rollback), `README-PUBLIC.md`, `RENDERER-ARCHITECTURE.md`, `PATCHES.md`, `COPYING-RULES.md` …) |
| `elysia/` `vendor/` `shaders/` | The CPU-renderer port (MIT, see §7.1(1)), vendored third-party code (MIT/ISC), and the 6 in-house API-compatible shader headers |
| `samples/` `demo/` `assets/` `extensions/` | The synthetic sample (the only bundled scene), the WebWallGL online bench (MIT artefacts redistributed), the open-licensed fonts distributed with the repository, and extension-hook examples |
| `archive/` | Local archive (**not in the repository**; skipped by `publish-check`) |

> The site root = the repository root: Pages publishes the repository root directly, so `index.html` / `demo.html` / `samples/` / `elysia/` and other **site entry points must stay at the root**;
> all other code lives by responsibility in `core/ server/ web/ tools/`, and the online URLs (`/demo.html`, `/sw.js`, `/manifest.webmanifest` …) are **character-for-character identical** to what they were before the reorganisation.

## 2. Loading a wallpaper

| How | URL | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Bundled sample | `?id=sample-synthetic` | The **only** scene bundled with the repository: a procedurally generated synthetic sample (no third-party assets), see `samples/` |
| Open the home page | no `?id=` | If this machine has no default corpus the page **says so explicitly** and renders the synthetic sample above instead |
| Local package file | `?pkgpath=/absolute/path/scene.pkg` | A path inside the server whitelist (override the whitelist with the colon-separated `MPW_ALLOW_DIRS`; the bundled `samples/` is already in the default whitelist) |
| Remote package URL | `?pkgurl=https://…/scene.pkg` | The server **fetches it as a proxy** (bypassing CORS) |
| **Workshop source folder** | `?pkgurl=http://127.0.0.1:8899/pkgdir?d=/absolute/folder` | The server **packs the folder into a container on the fly** and feeds that to the renderer; `/pkgdir?scan=1` lists the packable folders |
| Package id | `?id=<folder name>` | Matches a folder name in the two tiers `MPW_SCENE_ROOT` and `<repo>/samples`; **real wallpapers require you to supply the corpus** |

For debug flags such as `?ln=<N>` (layer-by-layer debugging), `?time=`/`?hour=` (pin the time of day) and `?showui` (show hidden UI layers), see `docs/README-DIAGNOSTICS.md`.

---

## 3. The bundled sample (`samples/`) — **this repository distributes no real wallpapers**

| Folder | Contents |
|---|---|
| `samples/sample-synthetic/` | The synthetic sample package: `scene.pkg` (≈33KB) + `project.json`. 5 layers: a gradient background, a composition container, an animated solid-colour bar, a dot that follows and scale-loops, and a text label bound to a property |
| `samples/sample-synthetic-src/` | The **loose source files** of the same scene (`scene.json`, `models/`, `materials/`). Packing them produces a result **byte-for-byte identical** to the `scene.pkg` above ⇒ it doubles as the "folder source" fixture |
| `tools/make-sample.mjs` | The generator: `node tools/make-sample.mjs` (deterministic — same arguments, same sha256); `--prod-verify` checks every item with the production parser |

The sample contains **no third-party assets or audio whatsoever** (all textures are generated procedurally by the script); keep real wallpapers **outside** the repository and
point `MPW_SCENE_ROOT` / `?pkgpath=` / `?pkgurl=` at your own copy (details in `samples/README.md`).

---

## 4. Environment variables (all have defaults; leaving them unset is equivalent to the author's machine)

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `8899` | Listen port |
| `MPW_ROOT` | this repository's parent directory | The base for other paths (`$MPW_ROOT/allwallpaper`, `$MPW_ROOT/wallpaper_engine/assets` …) |
| `MPW_SCENE_ROOT` | the first one that exists: `$MPW_ROOT/allwallpaper/dd` → `<repo>/samples`; if neither exists, a placeholder path that **explicitly does not exist** (the startup log says so, and every `?id=` returns 404) | The package-folder root for `?id=` |
| `MPW_REPORTS_DIR` | `$MPW_ROOT/reports` | Where `/report` reports are persisted (only the newest 60 are kept) |
| `MPW_WE_ASSETS` | auto-detected local Steam/WE install directory | The official WE-asset fallback (shaders/particle presets/materials); **not distributed with the repository** — skipped when not found |
| `MPW_ALLOW_DIRS` | several local directories + `<repo>/samples` | The path whitelist for `?pkgpath=`/`/pkgdir` (colon-separated) |
| `MPW_PLUGIN_CACHE` / `MPW_SD_ROOT` | plugin download cache / alternate corpus root | Extra roots for the corpus-scanning tools |
| `MPW_PKG_EXTRACT` | `<repo>/pkg-extract.mjs`, otherwise the plugin repository's path | The package parser (for a public copy, put `pkg-extract.mjs` at the repository root) |
| `MPW_PWA` | off | `1` = inject the PWA into the home page (manifest + SW registration) |

---

## 5. Known limitations

- Requires WebGL2; without a GPU it falls back to the CPU path (reduced functionality, markedly slower).
- Complex skinning/particles/effect chains are still being completed; the issue list and progress are in `tests/known-issues.json` and `docs/PATCHES.md`.
- Audio is not distributed with the repository: when you load a package containing audio, the page **parses it locally on your machine** for playback/export (see the audio panel in the renderer's top bar).
- In the pure static (no backend) shape, the wallpaper library list, property saving, `/report` and the WE-asset fallback are all unavailable (the controls are greyed out and the reason is stated).

## Data limits and automatic reporting (off by default)

Automatic reporting is **off by default**: unless you pass `?report=auto`, not a single timer is created; manual reporting is an explicit user action and is unaffected by the flag.
Everything that "writes to disk / writes to localStorage automatically" has **count + byte limits**; over the limit the **oldest is deleted first** and a log line is emitted (`[prune]` / `[limits]`):

| Artefact persisted | Limit | When it is pruned |
|---|---|---|
| `reports/r*.json` (`/report`; the automatic path is additionally limited to 4 times) | 60 files, 64MB combined with selfcheck | once before and once after writing |
| `reports/selfcheck-*.json` (`/diag` self-check/performance summaries) | 40 files | same as above |
| `reports/shots/<id>/*` (`/shot` burst capture) | 400 frames / 200MB per id; 500MB across all ids | same as above; when the global limit is exceeded, the "oldest frame across all ids" is deleted |
| Plugin diag snapshots (host side) | 50 / 32MB | pruned once at startup + before and after writing |
| `localStorage['mpw-props:<壁纸id>']` | 24 keys / 64KB per value / 512KB combined | LRU eviction |

Every limit constant has a **single source**; writing it anywhere else has no effect. The item-by-item list, the pruning log format, the 38 assertions that turn red, and the open items are in **`docs/DATA-LIMITS.md`** (gate `data-limits`).

- **This project's own code: GNU GPL version 3 or later (`GPL-3.0-or-later`)**, full text in the repository's `LICENSE`
  (the upper part = the unmodified GNU GPL v3 terms; the end carries the copyright notice and the "either version 3 … or (at your option) any later version" wording). SPDX identifier: `GPL-3.0-or-later`.
- **This repository contains no WE (Wallpaper Engine) assets whatsoever**: it distributes no `scene.pkg`/`.mpkg`, textures, official shader headers, audio, video or any Workshop work;
  the only bundled sample is the procedurally generated `samples/sample-synthetic*`.
- **This renderer imports the MIT-licensed plugin `dsh-mpkg-wallpaper`** (the package parser). That plugin **stays MIT**; the borrowing runs in the permitted MIT → GPL direction,
  **so the plugin's MIT notice is retained**, and it must not be overridden or removed by this repository's GPL.

## 7. References & credits

This section lists, one by one, the upstream projects this project has **genuinely referenced**, distinguishing three natures: ① **code/assets copied** (their licence notices must be retained); ② **imported as a dependency** (not copying);
③ **behaviour/format comparison only** (no code copied). **Anything that cannot be confirmed on this machine is written as "undetermined / to be verified", never guessed**; the legal text and full licences are governed by `THIRD-PARTY.md`, and the copying ledger by `docs/COPYING-RULES.md`.

### 7.1 Code copied — licence notices must be retained

#### (1) elysia395/dsh-wallpaper-engine — MIT
- Repository: <https://github.com/elysia395/dsh-wallpaper-engine> | Licence: **MIT** (`Copyright (c) 2026 elysia395`)
- **Copied/derived (to file level)**: `elysia/**` and `core/attach-transform.mjs` are **ports/derivative works** of the upstream `lib/we-renderer/**` and `lib/*.js`:
  - `elysia/we-renderer/**` — of its 43 files, **30 are byte-for-byte identical to upstream** (checked with `cmp`); the remaining 13 carry browser-portability patches only (the smallest changes just 2 import-path lines, the largest is a 135-line difference in `textures.js`). Coverage: the CPU scene-renderer core, `model.js`+`mdl.js` (MDL parsing), `puppet.js` (skeleton/skinned-mesh rasterisation), `effects/**` (blur/clouds/water ripples/god rays/depth-of-field parallax and other effect implementations), `glsl/**` (the GLSL interpreter and HLSL→GLSL translation), `jpeg.js`, `camera.js`, `bloom.js`, `canvas.js`, `text.js`.
  - `elysia/font-render.js` (1-line difference), `elysia/scene-scripts.js` (311-line difference, substantially extended beyond upstream), `elysia/scene-script-apis.js` (56-line difference) — the scene-script runtime and CFF text rasterisation.
  - `core/attach-transform.mjs` — a **verbatim port of 4 upstream functions** (`_mdlAnchors` / `_puppetBoneFinal` / `_attachmentOffset` / `resolveTransform`), used for attachment-anchor transforms.
  - 69 files / about 1.15 MiB in total. The renderer part was written by the upstream contributor **YV3507** (all 16 commits under `lib/we-renderer/`) and merged as PR #47 on 2026-08-25.
- **Licence notices retained in**: `elysia/LICENSE` (the full MIT text, distributed with the directory), `THIRD-PARTY.md` §1 (full MIT text), `docs/COPYING-RULES.md` §4 ledger **#1**.
- **Undetermined / to be verified**: the true origin of the JS shared between `elysia/scene-scripts.js` and the C++ strings embedded in `wer-ref` (elysia's MIT code, or a common WE-API ancestor) is **undetermined**; the suggested three-way diff has not been done yet.

#### (2) oneincase/webwallgl — MIT
- Repository: <https://github.com/oneincase/webwallgl> | Licence: **MIT** (`Copyright (c) 2026 oneincase`) | Reference commit for the comparison: `fdfc578a577d0e680a9cfe2cf2e3e825d3cd2372` (v1.3.23, 2026-09-15)
- **What was copied (to line level)**: **`FXAA_FRAG` (lines 452–489) verbatim** from the upstream `renderer/vendor/we-scene/render/renderer-glsl.js` into `core/we-scene-bundle.js`, under the constant name **`FXAA_FS`** (after normalisation 38/38 lines of GLSL are fully identical; the algorithmic constants match upstream: `SPAN_MAX=8.0`, `REDUCE_MUL=1/8`, `REDUCE_MIN=1/128`, `LUMA=(.299,.587,.114)`).
- **Whole-file vendoring (P-93)**: `vendor/hlsl2glsl/` = a **byte-for-byte copy** of the upstream HLSL→GLSL translator (`hlsl2glsl.js` 77,953 B / 1401 lines, `hlsl-preprocessor.js` 14,971 B / 423 lines, plus the upstream `LICENSE` 1,085 B; the three sha256 values are in `THIRD-PARTY.md` §9.1 — **not one character changed**). Not vendored: `render/headers.ts` (this project ships its own `common*.h`). Its only consumer today is the coverage gate `tests/hlsl2glsl-coverage-test.mjs`; the renderer's own shader path is not wired to it yet.
- **Behavioural comparison only (not copying)**: the `?q`/`?aa`/`?pp` quality tiers and the `setQuality` hot-update API (the AA/`pp` constant **value tables** are taken by value from the MIT `quality.ts`, with thanks), the pass orchestration (`runAAPass`, texture read-back, frame-token idempotence, `resolveAaMode`, the MSAA fallback strategy), and the vertex stage reusing this repository's existing full-screen triangle `BLOOM_VS`; on the plugin side `lib/web-wallpaper.js` (the WE API shim) has **0 lines copied**.
- **Static-artefact redistribution**: `demo/**` is the **static build of the WebWallGL online bench with this project's patches applied** (upstream artefacts such as `demo/assets/renderer-*.js`, `demo/assets/bench-*.js`, `demo/index.html` are **redistributed as-is**; `demo/bench-patch.js` is this project's runtime patch, under GPL-3.0-or-later, and does not modify the minified artefacts) ⇒ **the MIT notice ships with the directory**: `demo/LICENSE-webwallgl-MIT.txt` (full MIT text + attribution + a note saying which parts are upstream and which are ours). `demo/` contains **no wallpaper packages, preview images, audio/video or Workshop content**; the default scene is this repository's own synthetic sample. See `THIRD-PARTY.md` §6.4 and `docs/ONLINE-DEMO.md` for details.
- **Licence notices retained in**: the provenance comment above `FXAA_FS` in `core/we-scene-bundle.js`, `vendor/hlsl2glsl/LICENSE`, `THIRD-PARTY.md` **§6 and §9** (full MIT text), `docs/COPYING-RULES.md` §4 ledger **#6** (FXAA) and **#8** (the translator). Study records: `docs/WEBWALLGL-UPSTREAM-STUDY.md`, `docs/WEBWALLGL-DEMO-STUDY.md`.

#### (3) @shaderfrog/glsl-parser 7.0.1 — ISC (Andrew Ray)
- Repository: <https://github.com/ShaderFrog/glsl-parser> | Licence: **ISC** (per its `package.json`'s `"license": "ISC"`, `"author": "Andrew Ray"`)
- **What was copied**: the whole thing, **vendored and unmodified** — `elysia/vendor/@shaderfrog/glsl-parser/` (18 files / 685,630 B), used by `elysia/we-renderer/glsl/{executor,preprocess}.js` (the parsing front end of the GLSL interpreter).
- **Licence notices retained in**: `elysia/vendor/@shaderfrog/glsl-parser/LICENSE`, `elysia/LICENSE`, `THIRD-PARTY.md` §2.
- **Undetermined / to be verified (important)**: the upstream repository has **no** LICENSE file, and its README has no licence section either (GitHub `/license` = 404, npm package `/LICENSE` = 404) ⇒ that LICENSE file is **one we wrote from the package metadata**; the copyright year `2022` in it is **inferred** from the npm first-publish date, not upstream text.

### 7.2 Third-party assets distributed with the repository — their licences must be retained

- **Fonts (7 files + 12 licence/notice files)** — the per-file **upstream URL, retrieval date, byte count, sha256 and copyright line** are in `THIRD-PARTY.md` §4.1, and the full licence texts ship with the repository in `assets/fonts/licenses/`:

| File | Licence | Upstream |
|---|---|---|
| `Blackout 2 AM.ttf` | OFL-1.1 (RFN `Blackout`) | <https://github.com/theleagueof/blackout> |
| `monof55.ttf` | OFL-1.1 | the Debian `fonts-monofur` 1.0 upstream tarball |
| `NotoSans-Regular.ttf` | OFL-1.1 | <https://github.com/notofonts/noto-fonts> |
| `RobotoMono-Regular.ttf` | OFL-1.1 (**not** Apache-2.0; the copy inside WE is the 2015 build) | <https://github.com/googlefonts/RobotoMono> |
| `Segment7Standard.otf` | OFL-1.1 (RFN `Segment7`) | fontlibrary.org `/en/font/segment7` |
| `Twemoji.Mozilla.ttf` | artwork CC-BY-4.0 / code Apache-2.0 | <https://github.com/mozilla/twemoji-colr> (v0.7.0) |
| `spincycle_3d_ot.otf` | the author's freeware terms (Jess Latham / bvfonts.com) | <https://www.bvfonts.com/> (condition-by-condition comparison in `THIRD-PARTY.md` §4.6.1) |

  **Hard provenance rule**: **no file in `assets/fonts/` comes from a Wallpaper Engine installation directory**; WE's own font directory is only read **at runtime** (`/weassist/fonts/<name>`) and is never a packing source.
  **Deliberately not packaged** (no redistribution permission found — **undetermined / to be verified**): `Alcubierre.otf`, `Atami-Regular.otf`, `CursedTimerUlil-Aznm.ttf`, `Lazer84.ttf`, `kust.ttf`, `opensticks.ttf`, `summer85.ttf`, `8bitOperatorPlus8-Regular.ttf` — see `THIRD-PARTY.md` §4.7.
- **Peggy (MIT)** — **acknowledged only, not distributed**: `elysia/vendor/@shaderfrog/glsl-parser/parser/parser.js` is the machine-generated output of Peggy 1.2.0 (<https://peggyjs.org>). See `THIRD-PARTY.md` §3.

### 7.3 Imported as a dependency (not code copying)

#### dsh-mpkg-wallpaper — MIT
- Repository: <https://github.com/XHR666/dsh-mpkg-wallpaper> | Licence: **MIT**
- **How it is referenced/used**: the renderer **imports** the plugin's package parser (e.g. `parsePkg` / `readPkgEntry` in `server/we-scene-demo-server.mjs`). This is a **dependency**, not copied code.
- **Was any code copied directly**: **no**.
- **Obligation**: redistributing this renderer **must carry the plugin's MIT notice**; the plugin **stays MIT** and must not be overridden by this repository's GPL (MIT → GPL is a permitted one-way flow; the reverse is forbidden). Machine check: `tests/publish-check.mjs` asserts that the plugin package contains **no** GPL text.

### 7.4 Behaviour/format comparison only, no code copied (item by item)

#### (1) Almamu/linux-wallpaperengine — GPL-3.0-only
- Repository: <https://github.com/Almamu/linux-wallpaperengine> | Licence: **GPL-3.0-only** (its `packaging/archlinux/PKGBUILD` says `license=('GPL-3.0-only')`)
- **What was referenced (to file/feature level)**: as the **format-and-default-value authority** for `.tex` containers and particle/object properties, cited point by point in code comments: the texture container format (measured `TEXV0005` + `TEXI0001` + `TEXB0001~0004`) — compared against `TextureParser`; falling back to the **V3 layout** when the media is not MP4; the object property default at `ObjectParser.cpp:770` (`lengthDefault = (name=="ropetrail") ? 1.0 : 0.05`); the particle initialiser at `CParticle.cpp:767-778` (`createVelocityRandomInitializer`) and the control-point flags.
- **Was any code copied directly**: **no** (`docs/COPYING-RULES.md` §4 ledger has **no** entry for it ⇒ nothing was ever borrowed). The locally checked-out copy is outside the repository in `lwe-ref/` and is not committed.
- **Undetermined / to be verified**: the bit definitions of the particle flags have **no authoritative source** in either `lwe-ref` or `wer-ref` ⇒ marked "undetermined".

#### (2) Aromatic05/wallpaper-engine-renderer — GPL-2.0-only ✅ point-like same-origin fragments clean-room rewritten
- Repository: <https://github.com/Aromatic05/wallpaper-engine-renderer> | Licence: **GPL-2.0-only** (a fork of `catsout/wallpaper-scene-renderer`)
- **Disposition (2026-09-16 clean-room rewrite)**: the **2 point-like same-origin fragments** found by the audit (α normalisation, alignment offset) **have been rewritten** following the "five-step clean room" process in `docs/COPYING-RULES.md` §5, and **the old implementations have been deleted from `core/we-scene-bundle.js`**; the audit's original findings (including the deleted old identifiers) are kept in `docs/WER-REF-LICENSE-AUDIT.md` §3.4:
  ① **write the behaviour spec first** — `docs/IMAGE-ALPHA-ALIGN-SPEC.md` (α-normalisation truth table and "what must not be done", alignment token grammar and precedence, acceptance criteria);
  ② **implement from the spec alone** — `coerceImageAlphaMode` + `classifyAlphaDomain`/`saturateUnitInterval` (classification separated from conversion + named constants `ALPHA_UNIT_MAX`/`ALPHA_PERCENT_MAX`), `alignmentOffsetForToken` + `readAlignmentAxisSigns` + `ALIGNMENT_HALF_SHIFTS` (**token glyphs and offsets fully decoupled into a lookup table**, keyed by the sign pair);
  ③ **provably different on five axes**: naming, branch structure, constant organisation, data-structure shape and comment wording ("branch-by-branch isomorphism" is now 0 occurrences in `core/we-scene-bundle.js`);
  ④ **tests do not depend on upstream** — `tests/clean-room-alpha-align-test.mjs` reads only the spec and real corpora;
  ⑤ **behavioural difference: none** — that test is **1008 pass / 0 fail** (including "`Object.is` bit-for-bit cross-checks against the pre-change implementation" and a regression over 6 real packages / 408 layers of corpus).
  Weaker traces of the same kind have also been zeroed out: `__makeNoopVideoTexture` has **0 hits** repository-wide, and the upstream expression and the `WPNodeTransformResolver.cpp:154-156` line numbers in the parallax comment have been deleted.
- **Recorded trail**: `docs/PATCHES.md` **P-95** (a dedicated clean-room entry with the five-axis difference table and re-runnable evidence); `docs/WER-REF-LICENSE-AUDIT.md` §3.4 now carries **"✅ added after the fact (disposition result)"** (the original finding is kept unchanged, with a post-disposition comparison and a lineage re-test appended).
- **Scale and conclusion**: it was **point-like** (about 2 functions / ~11 lines), never a paragraph- or file-level port; the whole repository has **0 imports/requires/readFiles** of it; at the literal level, **0 comments copied, 0 error strings copied, 0 constant tables transcribed**.
- **Undetermined / to be verified**: the **legal characterisation** — **U-1** in the audit's §7 ("the very judgement that this once constituted a GPL-2.0-only derivative still needs a lawyer's opinion") and **U-5** ("whether the list is exhaustive") — **are still open**; the code-level disposition and trail do not replace legal advice.
- **Consistency items already closed**: the numbering is unified as **P-95** (source comments, acceptance tests, `docs/RENDERER-ARCHITECTURE.md` and `THIRD-PARTY.md` all now say P-95; P-91 in `docs/PATCHES.md` is a different matter = "distribution shape").
- The locally checked-out copy is outside the repository in `wer-ref/` (565 files / 9.2M) and is **not committed**; the borrowable table in `docs/COPYING-RULES.md` lists it as "❌ not borrowable" (and after the rewrite there is no longer any need to "borrow" from it).

#### (3) catsout/wallpaper-scene-renderer — GPL-2.0-only
- Repository: <https://github.com/catsout/wallpaper-scene-renderer> | Licence: **GPL-2.0-only** (**archived**, default branch `master`)
- **What was referenced**: only two things — ① it is the **archived upstream parent project** of the `wer-ref` fork (the two share one LICENSE blob); ② it serves as a **third-party corroboration** of "is the official behaviour right", by **quoting its behavioural conclusions only**.
- **Was any code copied directly**: **no**; this project has **no independent local checkout** of it.
- **Undetermined / to be verified**: its **file-by-file lineage** with `waywallen/open-wallpaper-engine` holds only at the level of the repositories' own statements (the README is entirely "Moved to …", the same LICENSE blob, creation/archival 9 minutes apart) and **has not** been confirmed commit by commit.

#### (4) waywallen/waywallen — MIT
- Repository: <https://github.com/waywallen/waywallen> | Licence: **MIT** (`bridge/LICENSE` is also MIT, same holder)
- **What was referenced**: **an architectural precedent only** — the layering of "permissively licensed host + copyleft renderer as a separate process" (based on the `[renderers.wescene-renderer]` section of its `plugin.toml.in`), used as evidence that a GPL component and an MIT host can coexist without contaminating each other.
- **Was any code copied directly**: **no** (that licence was never exercised; there is no entry in the ledger).

#### (5) waywallen/open-wallpaper-engine — GPL-2.0-only
- Repository: <https://github.com/waywallen/open-wallpaper-engine> | Licence: **GPL-2.0-only**
- **What was referenced**: **zero contact** (it appears only in the licence-compatibility analysis as "❌ not borrowable", and in `wer-ref`'s own migration notes — that is lineage **between upstreams**, unrelated to this repository). **Was any code copied**: **no**.

#### (6) aqnya/unmpkg — GPL-3.0 (`.mpkg` format reference only)
- Repository: <https://github.com/aqnya/unmpkg> | Licence: **GPL-3.0** | **What was referenced**: the `.mpkg` binary **format** only. **Was any code copied**: **no**; the parsing script that claimed to reference it (38 lines) was deleted on 2026-09-16 (because code-level lineage could not be ruled out). **Undetermined / to be verified**: the statement "format reference only" **cannot be confirmed on this machine** (there is no local checkout).

#### (7) notscuffed/repkg — **MIT** (verified and closed on 2026-09-16)
- Repository: <https://github.com/notscuffed/repkg> | Licence: **MIT** (`Copyright (c) 2019 notscuffed`)
- **Basis**: the upstream `LICENSE` text (full MIT text; first re-checked 2026-09-16, **re-verified 2026-09-17** at <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notscuffed/repkg/master/LICENSE>) plus the project owner's confirmation. The GPL side recorded in existing documents (`docs/COPYING-RULES.md`, `docs/PLUGIN-POLLUTION-AUDIT.md`, the plugin README ×2, etc.) **was an early mis-recording in this repository and is void and corrected** — **every correction landed on 2026-09-17**, with the list in `docs/LICENSE-COMPAT-REVIEW.md` §10.1 at the workspace root; the rule amendment is in `docs/COPYING-RULES.md` §6 + **§9.10**.
- **What was referenced**: cited as the **format/value authority** for `.tex` decoding (the RG88 convention `(rgb=G, a=R)`, consistent with ImageSharp `Rgba32`, greyscale = second channel G / alpha = first channel R, and so on).
- **Was any code copied directly**: **no (not literally)**. Even if "BC1/BC2/BC3 **aligned line by line with RePKG's LibSquish port**" in `core/we-scene-bundle.js` has a factual basis, that is a **permitted** MIT → GPL direction, with attribution and terms in `THIRD-PARTY.md`; the 267-line script that claimed to reference it was deleted on 2026-09-16. There is **no local checkout** (not vendored in the workspace).

#### (8) Aromatic05/we-layerd — **no licence (all rights reserved)**
- Repository: <https://github.com/Aromatic05/we-layerd> | Licence: **no LICENSE file = all rights reserved** (stricter than the GPL)
- **Licence verification (2026-09-17, L2)**: GitHub API `"license": null`; there is no `LICENSE`/`COPYING`/`NOTICE` in the upstream root;
  `Cargo.toml` (root + 4 member crates) has **no `license`/`license-file`/`repository`**; the upstream's **own packaging metadata admits it is unlicensed**
  (`package/archlinux/PKGBUILD:9` = `license=('custom:unlicensed')`, `package/fedora/we-layerd.spec:8` = `License: LicenseRef-Unlicensed`).
  **Also**: its `.gitmodules` bundles **GPL-2.0-only** `Aromatic05/wallpaper-engine-renderer` (pin `89dfcd86…`, = this workspace's `wer-ref/`)
  as a render-core submodule ⇒ even "write it yourself from their implementation" must avoid that submodule.
- **What was referenced**: a single behavioural comparison ("this feature has zero implementation" as corroboration). **Was any code copied directly**: **no** (repository-wide references = 26 files / 37 lines of **text only**,
  with **0** hits for `import`/`readFile`). The local checkout is outside the repository in `we-layerd-ref/`, **not committed** and **not in any artefact**.
- **Disposition**: `docs/COPYING-RULES.md` **§9.8** (L2 complete ⇒ keep zero introduction); the general ladder for unlicensed / incompatible upstreams is in the same file's **§9 (L1–L5)**.

### 7.5 Assessed in licence-compatibility research only — **its code was not referenced**

- **NixaXI/AnisPaper** — repository <https://github.com/NixaXI/AnisPaper> | Licence: **GPL-3.0** (its `LICENSE` says GPL-3.0 only, while the project's own description says or-later in several places ⇒ **conflicting statements; conservatively treated as GPL-3.0-only**, **undetermined / to be verified**).
  **Its code was not referenced**: the record in this repository states explicitly "no code borrowed from it this round", and there is **no local checkout**; it appears only in the licence-compatibility analysis (in fact it is C++/CMake + Qt + KDE Plasma 6).

### 7.6 Researched but **not adopted** (listed to make clear that "what was not referenced does not go above")

`Paradox07127/macos-wallpaperengine` (MIT), `oneincase/WallpaperEM` (MIT), `pbadgpmeb22791-sketch/dsh-we-wallpaper` (MIT) — research only;
`lucaschnabel42/wallgl` (**no licence ⇒ not borrowable**), `NikoPit/wallpaper-engine-assets` (`license: null` ⇒ cannot serve as a precedent for "redistributable") — explicitly excluded;
`enenesser/earth-webgl` (search noise, not a project of this kind).

### 7.7 Wallpaper Engine itself (proprietary) — not distributed with the repository

- Wallpaper Engine is **proprietary software** on Valve/Steam, and its assets are bound by the Steam Subscriber Agreement. This repository **distributes no** WE assets:
  textures, official shader headers, particle presets, fonts, audio, video and Workshop works are all absent; at runtime it reads from **the user's own** WE installation via `MPW_WE_ASSETS`.
- All 6 headers actually referenced by this project's internal shaders have been replaced with **in-house API-compatible implementations**
  (`shaders/common.h` / `common_blending.h` / `common_blur.h` / `common_composite.h` / `common_fragment.h` / `common_perspective.h`),
  each file header stating `Original implementation for this project; API-compatible with the shader includes used here. No third-party code.`
- `common_vertex.h` is **deliberately not published** (zero references in the pipeline, zero calls to `BuildTangentSpace`; after the rewrite it "overlaps 100% of the effective lines" with the WE original, so it does not count as a clean-room product):
  the recorded scope is formally **6 files**, and both the originals and the replacements are kept in an evidence archive outside the repository; the three facts and the reproduction commands are in `docs/COMMON-HEADERS-REPLACEMENT.md` **§1.1**.

## Licence & credits

> This section is the landing point of **the single link in the deliverable panel** (the `:8902` bench's "Settings → Attribution & licences" keeps just one line linking here,
> no longer piling attribution and full licence texts into the page). Its wording is consistent across three places — here, `THIRD-PARTY.md` and `docs/COPYING-RULES.md`;
> if an inconsistency is found, **facts prevail** and all three are corrected together.

| Item | Licence | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **This repository** (renderer / bundled server / bench) | **GPL-3.0-or-later** | Full text in the repository root `LICENSE`. Distributing this repository or a derivative work requires providing the source under GPL-3.0-or-later as well |
| **Upstream rendering core**: WebWallGL ([oneincase/webwallgl](https://github.com/oneincase/webwallgl)) | **MIT** | This repository's rendering core was **independently rewritten/ported** from it; the MIT licence requires retaining its copyright and licence notices — full texts in `demo/LICENSE-webwallgl-MIT.txt` and `demo/LICENSE-webwallgl` (**the files remain in the repository**; they are simply no longer listed as separate links on the page) |
| **Other third-party components** (vendored translator, fonts, reference implementations, etc.) | registered item by item | See [`THIRD-PARTY.md`](THIRD-PARTY.md): each entry gives the version, origin, licence and "whether it is distributed with the package" |
| **Wallpaper Engine itself and its assets** | proprietary (Valve/Steam) | **Not distributed with this repository**; at runtime it reads only from **the user's own** WE installation (see the previous section) |
| **Real wallpaper packages** (Workshop works / user corpora) | owned by their respective authors | **Not distributed with this repository**: it carries only one **self-made synthetic sample** (generated by `tools/make-sample.mjs`); user corpora stay outside the repository, pointed at with `MPW_SCENE_ROOT` / `?pkgpath=` |

**Why only one link on the page**: attribution and full licence texts belong to the **repository documentation** (what the GPL requires to be "provided with the distribution" is the repository's
`LICENSE` / `THIRD-PARTY.md` / the two upstream MIT full-text files); pasting the full texts into the product UI both hurts readability and drifts with versions;
the UI's only job is to **point you at the single authoritative location**.

---

*The record of how this section's wording was reconciled with `THIRD-PARTY.md` and `docs/COPYING-RULES.md` is in `docs/PATCHES.md`;
if the three are found to be inconsistent, **facts prevail** and all three are corrected together.*
